Simple crypto-related app

## Description

Our app lets you view basic info about various different popular crypto currencies and it also allows you to simulate trading. You have your own little space - portfolio, where all your 'purchased' cryptos are kept. App has neat features, like letting you know whenever you are disconnected from the internet, so you instantly know why crypto prices aren't updating. Additionally, app will also inform you of any significant changes to crypto prices with a push notification.

## Getting Started

Just download the app, launch it and you are ready to go!

## FAQ

Q. Will I be able to also simulate selling my purchased items in the near future?

A. Sadly, this feature will take some time to get added, but will definitely arrive eventually.


Q. I see that there isn't much info displayed for each crypto currency. Why not? You definitely could add more.

A. You see, main advantage of our app is that it's compact and quite simple. It provides all the necessary info and we don't plan on adding additional details.


Q. Loving this simplistic approach. Will you be creating more apps in the future related to something else (maybe stocks)?

A. Great question. Answering it will be a bad spoiler though, so we'll be quiet for now, but definitely look out for something.
